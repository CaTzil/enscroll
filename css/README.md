# This directory is intentionally left empty

Since we are now using SASS to precompile our stylesheets, the style.css file that is normally present in this directory will no longer be included in the project.  Instead, you can install the sass ruby gem and precompile these stylesheets for yourself.

Head over to http://sass-lang.com/ for a tutorial and instructions for installation on any platform.
